# Cookie Factory - Industrial Security Boundary Analysis Lab

## Overview

This interactive web application simulates a cookie factory to teach students about system boundaries, interconnections, and data flows in industrial environments from a cybersecurity perspective.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn to identify:

- **Physical Boundaries**: Physical separation between areas and systems
- **Operational Boundaries**: Different operational zones and processes  
- **Functional Boundaries**: Systems with different functions and purposes
- **Logical Boundaries**: Network segments and data access controls

## How to Use

### Starting the Application

### Interactive Elements

- Click on production areas to identify boundaries and connections
- Use checkboxes to toggle different boundary types and flow visualizations
- Click individual systems within areas to explore functional boundaries
- Click external systems to see external interconnections
- Network segments show logical boundary separations

### Analysis Features

- **Boundary Identification**: Automatically categorizes boundaries when elements are clicked
- **Interconnection Mapping**: Shows system-to-system connections with visual lines
- **Data Flow Visualization**: Displays how information flows through the factory
- **Real-time Analysis**: Updates analysis panel as you explore the system

## Factory Components

### Production Areas

- **Mixing Area**: Recipe preparation, ingredient handling
- **Baking Area**: Cooking processes, quality monitoring  
- **Packaging Area**: Final product preparation, inventory management

### Support Systems

- **Central Control Room**: SCADA systems, production database
- **Maintenance Office**: Work order management, maintenance logs

### External Systems  

- **Raw Material Supplier**: Ingredient delivery, supply chain
- **External Quality Lab**: Safety testing, certifications
- **Distribution Network**: Shipping, retail partnerships

### Network Infrastructure

- **Production Network**: Isolated operational technology (OT) network
- **Corporate Network**: Business systems with internet connectivity

## Key Concepts for Analysis

### Boundary Types

1. **Physical**: Walls, fences, building separations
2. **Operational**: Different work processes and procedures
3. **Functional**: Systems performing different functions
4. **Logical**: Network segments, access controls, data boundaries

### Critical Interconnections

- Production systems to control networks
- External supplier connections
- Quality assurance data flows
- Maintenance system access points

### Security Considerations

Students should consider:

- Where external connections create risk
- How data flows between trust zones
- Physical access control points
- Network segmentation effectiveness

## Controls

- **Ctrl+R**: Reset analysis
- **Checkboxes**: Toggle boundary types and flow visibility
- **Reset Button**: Clear all identified boundaries and connections

## Assessment

Students should document:

1. All four boundary types identified in the system
2. Critical interconnections between internal and external systems
3. Data flow paths and their security implications
4. Recommendations for improving boundary security

## ToDo

- add new lab to identify logical and physical boundaries
- add new lab to identify data flows
- add new lab to identify interconnections

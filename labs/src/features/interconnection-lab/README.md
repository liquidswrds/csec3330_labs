# Interconnection & Dataflow Analysis Lab

## Overview

The Interconnection & Dataflow Analysis Lab is an interactive cybersecurity learning module that teaches students how to identify, analyze, and assess security risks in industrial control system interconnections. Built for the CSEC 3330 Industrial System Security course, this lab provides hands-on experience with realistic factory systems and cybersecurity concepts.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn to:

1. **Map System Interconnections**: Identify and create connections between industrial control systems, sensors, and infrastructure components
2. **Analyze Data Flows**: Understand different types of data flowing between systems and their security implications
3. **Assess Security Risks**: Evaluate potential attack vectors and security vulnerabilities in interconnected systems
4. **Apply Cybersecurity Principles**: Use industry-standard protocols and security best practices in system design

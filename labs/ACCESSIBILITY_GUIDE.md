## **Learning Strategy for Blind Users**

### **Conceptual Understanding**

1. **Factory Layout Mental Model**:
   - Four operational zones (External, Manufacturing, Support, Network)
   - Each zone contains multiple functional elements
   - Assignments create logical relationships

2. **Assignment Logic**:
   - **Functional**: WHAT the system does (its purpose/function)
   - **Operational**: HOW systems are grouped organizationally

### **Success Tips**

1. **Use Tutorial First**: Comprehensive explanation of concepts
2. **Start with Keyboard Mode**: More reliable than drag-and-drop
3. **Read Element Descriptions**: Each element has helpful context
4. **Check Progress Frequently**: Use "Check Answers" for immediate feedback
5. **Use Assignment Guide**: Reference panel provides definitions
